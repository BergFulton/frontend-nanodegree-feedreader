##Udacity RSS Feedreader Testing Project

###What is this? 
This is a suite of Javascript tests written for completion of the Udacity Frontend Web Development Nanodegree program.

###What does it do?
The code in `./spec/feedreader.js` contains a series of tests for the functionality of the Feedreader site (`index.html`). 

It uses [Jasmine v 2.1](http://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction.html) to help visualize test results. 

This wasn't a "test driven" implementation. The site was already complete, and tests were being written to test functionality, rather than building the site around the needs of the test. 

###How can I see it? 
You can fork/clone this repo, then open up `index.html` in a browser of your choosing. 
Alternatively, I've published this site to GitHub pages right [here](https://bergfulton.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/).

###Who helped?
Lots of help was had from the Udacity forums, the Jasmine documentation, and [Patrick Fulton](http://www.github.com/pfulton).
